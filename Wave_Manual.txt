1 - Introduction & Overview
WAVE is a 3 Channel Music Editor using the traditional Tracker Environment.
WAVE features full control of Channels Volume, Note and Pitch plus EG support and one Channel 4 bit Samples
SID may also be applied to a channel with Buzzer, Channel or Status Styles.

1.1 - Booting WAVE
WAVE is only available on an Oric Atmos with Disk Drive. It has not been tested on the real machine
but is preferred on the Emulator. Music files may only be saved or loaded from Disk. Tape is not
supported.

The Wave disk contains all the program, data and all resources.

Insert the disk and reboot the machine (F6 on Euphoric Emulator)
Alternatively insert disk and type MENU followed by the return key

The Menu is the central point of all WAVE resources.
However at the time of release only 3 options are supported...

In the Main Menu Option 1 will take you to the Music Editor.
In the Compiler Menu only Options 4 and 5 are available.

For information on Compiling the music turn to section 3.1
For information on the Wave Music Editor read on...

The WAVE display consists of two screens only.

 * The main edit screen contains all the editors and will manage all editing
 * The disk directory and disk operations
 
The main edit screen consists of all editable areas of the music.
From the top is the menu and below it is the List Editor.
Below that is the Pattern Editor and below that three boxes.
From the left is the Sample Viewer, Effect Editor and Ornament Editor.
   
1.2 - Edit Menu
On bootup of WAVE the top left menu option (FILE) is highlighted.
Their are two alternate menus. The Edit menu and the File menu. This is the Edit menu.

From the Edit Menu you may navigate left/right with the cursor keys, select an option with either Return
or Space or modify the tempo (can be done in the menu but not neccesary to be over the tempo option).

The options are as follows

FILE 	- Go to the FILE menu
LIST 	- Enter the List Editor
PATT 	- Enter the Pattern Editor
EFFE 	- Enter the Effect Editor
ORNA 	- Enter the Ornament Editor
SAMP 	- Enter the Sample Viewer
TM10 	- This reflects the Default music tempo and may be modified with - and = keys

The last two options are the PLAY and STOP icons to play and stop the music. However in most editors
the playing of the music can be started and stopped.

By Default you can get to the Menu section by pressing ESC from any editor.

1.3 - File Menu
To enter the file menu select the FILE option in the top menu. Select again to return to the edit menu.

The options are as follows

EDIT   	- Go to the FILE menu
LOAD   	- Load a tune or Sample Pack from disk
SAVE   	- Save a tune to disk (The saved tune will contain all music plus all keys)
UPDATE 	- Update Save the tune to disk (No need to enter filename again)
DIR	- Display the disks directory
NEW       - Erase all Music Memory
MMENU     - Return to Main WAVE Menu

And now some additional notes on some of those options
LOAD
WAVE files all have the extension .WVE regardless if Sample packs or Music files.
There is no discrimination between the two types.

Note: Before exiting to display the current directory the program will always ask for
      confirmation in the message area.

All Music and Samples will be stopped prior to displaying the Directory and loading a file.
When entering the filename you MUST NOT include the extension.

SAVE
Save allows you to save a new tune to Disk. Each tune uses the same amount of disk space
regardless the size of the tune being worked on. The program stores the music as a flat file
which is always 26,500 Bytes or 105 Sectors.


UPDATE
Saves the current music being worked on to disk using either the default name ("DEFAULT")
or the last filename saved to disk.
During Update save the screen will momentarily vanish.

NEW
Selecting NEW will prompt you to confirm you wish to Erase the music currently in memory
after which the program will erase all music including List data, Patterns, Effects and Ornaments.
Samples will remain since their values can never be modified in the editors, only utilised.
The Music Tempo will return to 10.

However the filename currently being used will still remain so don't accidentally UPDATE save
unless you intend to do so.

MMENU
Selecting MMENU(Main MENU) will prompt you to confirm you wish to Quit the application then will
return you to the main WAVE menu.

All music data will be lost so make sure you've saved it to Disc!


1.4 - List
Music in WAVE is constructed using a LIST which contains Patterns which contain the notes
to play.

The List is shown in the blue row just below the top menu.
The List may contain up to 128 entries and a tune may be looped.


1.5 - Patterns
Each Pattern is a container for notes that are played.

Most elements of the Oric Sound chip can be played with in WAVE and Samples may also
be used.

The primary 3 channels are shown in Yellow and Cyan.
The yellow columns hold the notes which are spaced with rests inbetween.
The play routine steps through each row at an even tempo set by the music tempo TMxx in the top menu.

The far left green "S" column is the Sample column. Each row can potentially play a Sound sample aswell
as chip channels.

the Magenta "EGC" column is for setting the period and waveform for the Envelope Generator. The range is a
little limited due to implementing the Envelope generator as a sound source rather than a volume envelope.
The possible waveforms and Triangle or Sawtooth and the range of notes are from C-0 to about D-2.

The green "N" column may hold a Noise level for the row. Noise is actually a seperate sound generator
inside the Sound Chip but unfortunately is brough out on any one of the chip channels so they must
have noise enabled before it is heard.

The Yellow columns contain the Note or Rest. Notes range from C-0 to C-6 but may be taken further using
Effects, Ornaments or Pitchbend.
Notes always have an associated Volume (the first field in the Cyan column to the right). The range of
volumes are limited to 4 levels. ie. 0,4,8 and 15.
Rests may also have a zero volume to represent a Silence Rest. This is useful to silence a note before
its effect or ornament has finished.

The Cyan columns contains 5 fields.
V  This is the volume as described previously
E  This is the Effect field and is shown with hexadecimal values from 0 to E or None (-)
    Up to 15 Effects are available. Each Effect can modify the Pitch and Volume of the Note.
    Effects are also used for enabling or disabling Noise and the EG.
O  This is the Ornament field and is shown with hexadecimal values from 0 to E or None (-)
    Up to 15 Ornaments are available. Each Ornament modifies the note by up to 31 steps and in the
    range of -128 to +127. Each entry is always relative to the original Pattern Note.
CP This is the Command ID and Parameter. A Command can be applied to each Channel so up to 3 commands
   can exist on each row.
   Commands are shown as letters followed by the Parameter (P) field which always ranges 32 values shown
   as extended hexadecimal format 0-V.
    C - Apply Channel SID, Status SID or Turn off SID
    	For Channel SID the Parameter specifies the EOR Value(0-F). The Patern Volume sets the first value
    	For Status SID set the parameter to "S"
    	To turn off SID set the parameter to "O"
    Z - Apply Buzzer SID
    	The parameter specifies the EOR Value(0-F). The Initial cycle is set by the Cycle Column
    S - Apply Samples to this channel
    	The Parameter is not currently used. Samples are always played at the Note Frequency
    T - Set the current music Tempo
    	The Parameter specifies the Tempo(0-31)
    B - Apply Pitchbend to this channel
    	The Parameter specifies the number of steps between semitones(0-7)
    O - Trigger Out - Writes the value of P to the Trigger location to control external events
    	The Parameter specifies the value to write to the Trigger Variable
    - - -


A note does not need an Effect or an Ornament to play. Infact a pretty decent tune can be had by not
using them at all.

1.6 - Effects
An Effect is a sequence of up to 31 events that are applied to the Pattern note and optionally looped.
Each entry can be one of 8 types and are as follows

  0 Loop or End
  1 Noise Off
  2 EG Off
  3 Tone Off
  4 Tone On and Pitch Offset
  5 Noise On and Noise Offset
  6 EG On and EGPeriod Offset
  7 Tone On and Volume Offset
    If the volume overlaps (<0 or >15) then this ends the Effect

The Offset is always -16 to +15
For Noise, EG and Pitch the change is always relative to the original note.
For volume the change is absolute(permanent).
Up to 15 Effects can be defined

By default a new note is always played with Tone on and Noise Off.

1.7 - Ornaments
An Ornament is a sequence of up to 31 Semitone Offsets that are applied to the Pattern Note
Each Entry holds a range of -128 to +127.

Ornaments may be used to simulate chords or percussion instruments such as drums

1.8 - Samples
WAVE supports one channel 10Khz 4Bit Samples. 8Kbytes are assigned to Samples and are internally
stored in either the top or bottom 4 bits of each byte.
The samples may be looped.

A sample always plays on Channel C. Samples are best played without the Channels Noise or Tone interfering.
To facilitate this a Note should be placed at the very start of Channel C with an Effect that disables
the Tone (TONE OFF).

1.9 - Key Help
Every Editor is provided with a Help Screen (CTRL+H by default).
The Help screens hold a description of all keys used in each Editor.
They are referred to as the Help Editor or Key Editor since they also allow any key to be redefined by
the user.

All keys are stored with the music file that is saved to Disk.

1.10 - Playing Music
The area between the Sample Viewer and the Message row contains information about the tune currently
playing.
||| PR/LRW

||| 3 Red Bars reflect the Volumes of each of the Chip channels from A to C.
    These are shown in real time but at a lower resolution than the Volume channel due to space restrictions.
    Each bar may be..
    solid red 	- Tone and reflecting the Volume on the channel
    Dithered Red	- Noise and reflecting the Volume on the channel
    Character E	- EG has Channel
    Character S	- Sample has Channel(which currently is limited to Channel C)
    Character X	- Channel is disabled or Muted

PR  To the right of the Bars is a 2 digit number which reflects the Current Pattern Row being played

LRW To the right of that is the List index currently being played

2 - Editors
All Editors are displayed in the same static screen you see on bootup. So everything is immediately visible.


2.1 - List Editor
To enter the List editor Select it from the Top Menu or Press CTRL+L from any Editor.
The List Editor will display a cursor on the current entry which is indicated by the Index in the row above.

The List consists of a sequence of Patterns (from left to right) that are played in succession one after
the other.
At the end of the composition the List may be looped by specifying a Loop position. The Loop position is
indicated with an L to the left of the Pattern number instead of a P.


2.2 - Pattern Editor
To enter the Pattern editor Select it from the Top Menu or Press CTRL+P from any Editor.



2.3 - Effect Editor
To enter the Effect editor Select it from the Top Menu or Press CTRL+E from any Editor.

2.4 - Ornament Editor
To enter the Ornament editor Select it from the Top Menu or Press CTRL+O from any Editor.

2.5 - Sample Viewer
To enter the Sample Viewer Select it from the Top Menu or Press CTRL+S from any Editor.

2.6 - Key Editor
All editors are provided roughly the same range of command keys and all share the same usual key.
For example Copy, Cut and Paste commands are available in both the List, Pattern and Effect Editors
and use the keys CTRL+C, CTRL+X and CTRL+V by default. Similarly highlighting takes the form of SHIFT
plus a cursor key to highlight in that direction and like Windows CTRL+A will highlight everything.

The Playing of the music also centres around the Return and Space Bar. Return in combination with
Shift to play and Space Bar always to Stop.

Switching between Editors 

3.1 - Wave Compiler
Any music produced(and saved) in the Music Editor is always 26.5K. This is because the Music Editor
uses a flat-file to store all the music elements including the session preferences.
A Compiler will extract only the music that was composed and convert it to a format that is much
smaller (typically 80% smaller).
The Compiler will then add a specially optimised player onto the end and either save the resultant file
to Disc(Option 4) or Print just the music data to the local Printer (option 5).

3.2 - Compiling BASIC TEXT IRQ Driver
This will compile the tune to sit as far up in memory suitable for operation in a TEXT only environment.

To compile a tune select Option 4 from the Compiler Menu. The disc directory will now show only WAVE
files. Enter your tunes filename (DO NOT include the extension) then press Enter.
The program will compile the tune and save it to a file with the same filename but the extension .CWF
This file holds the compiled music data. The Compiler will then add the Player code to the end and
save the final file to disc with the .COM extension.

To load the compiled tune and player, simple load the .COM file.
To Play the song always CALL #B000
To Stop the song always CALL #B1C5

In order to have the music resident in memory whilst you are using BASIC it it neccesary to set the
top of BASIC memory using the HIMEM command (otherwise BASIC may corrupt or even crash the music).
To find out what to set HIMEM to Load the music with the ,V switch at the end. This will return the
Start and End address of the Compiled tune.
Set HIMEM to 1 below the Start Address.

For example LOAD"EXAMPLE1",V will return ADA1 B4FF 40 0000
You would then set place HIMEM #ADA0 at the very start of your BASIC program.

3.3 - Compiling and Printing an XA Compliant Music Block
This option was added for those wishing to use music in Cross assembled Machine Code using the popular XA
Compiler as provided in DBUGs fantastic OSDK package.
The option will compile the tune then generate .byt statements (in rows of 16 bytes) to the printer file.

However it is imperitive that the PRINTER IS SWITCHED ON during this operation otherwise the machine WILL
crash.

A countdown will be displayed in the top left indicating the progress of the printing.
After completed and returning to the menu, turn off the Printer and collect the Printer file.

At the time of release it was found the last data statement contains an error. Add $00 to the end.

In the ZIP file (that WAVE is packaged in) you will find the xa source for the Player(Wave_Player.s).
The Player must allign to a Page. Not only this but be aware that the actual allignment is required further
down the source in the Effect section of the code so amendments made above must not upset the page
allignment.

However the Music data file collected from the printer file can be placed anywhere in memory.
Just tell the player where the start of the music data is (in the MUSICBASEADDRESS constant).
To play the music JSR InitMusic
To Stop the music JSR TerminateMusic

4.6 - Pitch, Volume and Noise Elements
WAVE Pitch is calculated as follows
(Pattern Note +/- Ornament) >> Pitch +/- Effect Pitch >> AY

WAVE Volume (Samples always act on Volumes so avoid setting it during)
Pattern Volume +/- Effect Volume >> AY

WAVE Noise
Pattern Noise +/- Effect Noise >> AY

WAVE EGPeriod (Always 8 bit only)
Pattern EG +/- Effect EG >> AY

4.7 - WAVE Samples
WAVE Samples are held in an 8K block of memory from $5672 to $76CC.
Up to 7 Samples can be used.

Each Sample is always played at 10Khz 4 Bit and may reside in the top or bottom nibble.
However the End of the sample is indicated by a Zero in the Nibble so the resolution is reduced slightly.

Samples are played concurrently to the Tracker Editor. So it is possible to play a looped 10Khz sample
whilst browsing editors :P
However all Samples and Music will stop as soon as any changes are made to the Music.

4.10 - Outstanding issues
>> Mute Control
The Mute key in the Pattern Editor does not do anything. There is no Mute facility
>> Ornament Copy,Cut,Paste
There is currently no facility in the Ornament Editor to highlight and copy in the Ornament Editor
>> Trigger not shown
When playing a Trigger Out event is not visibly shown
>> Pattern Tempo is broken
The Pattern Tempo command does not modify the Tempo
>> Sample is not shown
When playing a sample an S does not appear in the Play monitor area

5 - Demonstrations and Resource files
EXAMPLE1
Demonstrates simple 3 channel harmony using some Effects and one Ornament towards the end.

EXAMPLE2
The first two Patterns concentrate on demonstrating the EG as a good Triangle Bass sound

The third Pattern demonstrates using the Noise column to dynamically change the noise over the
total duration of the pattern.

The fourth pattern onwards demonstrates mixing EG, Chip and Samples into a composition.

Please note these tunes are not masterpieces and are only present to demonstrate using the various
WAVE musical elements.
Also note that some Users may experience a slowdown after the pieces have finished playing. Press
the Space Bar (Default key) to turn off all the music. This should restore the speed of operation
to what it was before.
